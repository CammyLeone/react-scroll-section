# Getting started

## Installation

The library is available as a package in npm and yarn, so use the one you prefer the most.

``` bash
# npm
$ npm install react-scroll-section

# yarn
$ yarn add react-scroll-section
```

## Usage

The library provides you 3 components:

* ScrollingProvider: responsible to link `Section` and `SectionLink` and know which `Section` is selected. 
* SectionLink: giving a `Section` ID will perform the navigation after clicking on it. This is the best approach when you know the amount of sections your application has.
* SectionLinks: provides all the `Section` references registered inside the application. This is perfect when you want to dinamically add links depending on the section you have.
* Section: just a `<section />` that receives a `Section` ID and register itself on `ScrollingProvider`.

So if you group them all together, you would end up with the following pseudo code: 

``` jsx
  <ScrollingProvider>
    <div>
      <SectionLink section="home">
        {({ onClick, isSelected}) => (
          <Item onClick={onClick} selected={isSelected}> Home </Item>
        )}
      </SectionLink>
      <SectionLink section="about">
        {({ onClick, isSelected}) => (
          <Item onClick={onClick} selected={isSelected}> About </Item>
        )}
      </SectionLink>
    </div>
    <Section id="home">Home section</Section>
    <Section id="about">About section</Section>
  </ScrollingProvider>
```
