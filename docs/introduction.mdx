# Introduction

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <h1>React Scroll Section</h1> 
  <img src={logoSvg} alt="React Scroll Section logo" />
  <h2>
    <strong>A declarative solution to vertically navigate your React App</strong>
  </h2>
</div>

## Why you should use it? ü§î

When you think about implementing a `scrollTo` functionality in a website the first thing it will your mind will be jQuery, using the following line of code: 

``` javascript
  $( "#target" ).scroll();
```

I won't deny that actually works, but the problem comes when you start working with frameworks based on component, like React.

Manage the navigation to another section and which section can be hard task without a state management library.

This library will help you to avoid thinking all the possible edges cases and focus on the final result, which is just provide an easy navigation inside your app.

## Basic Example ‚úÖ

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/30qmm4m2j5?view=preview" style={{width:'100%', height:'500px', border:0, borderRadius: '4px', overflow:'hidden'}} sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
