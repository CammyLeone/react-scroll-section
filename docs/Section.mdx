# Section

## Properties

<PropsTable of={Section} />

##  Usage

Just render the all the Section in the order you want. Also the structure of your components doesn't matter!

``` javascript
<Section id="home">
  Home
</Section>
<Section id="about">
  About
</Section>
<p>You have whatever you want in the middle of Sections üòÅ</p>
<div>
  <Section id="projects">
    Projects
  </Section>
</div>
```

**WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è: Avoid using the duplicated id for sections, due to they to be overwritten by the last one define.**
